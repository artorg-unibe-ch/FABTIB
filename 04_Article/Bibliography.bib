abstract = {Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is an inherited form of bone fragility characterised by impaired synthesis of type I collagen, altered trabecular bone architecture and reduced bone mass. High resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a powerful method to investigate bone morphology at peripheral sites including the weight-bearing distal tibia. The resulting 3D reconstructions can be used as a basis of micro-finite element (FE) or homogenized finite element (hFE) models for bone strength estimation. The hFE scheme uses homogenized local bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and anisotropy information (fabric) to compute healthy bone strength within a reasonable computation time using fabric-elasticity relationships. However, it is unclear if these relationships quantified previously for healthy controls are valid for trabecular bone from OI patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate fabric-elasticity relationships in OI trabecular bone compared to healthy controls. In the present study, the morphology of distal tibiae from 50 adults with OI were compared to 120 healthy controls using second generation HR-pQCT. Six cubic regions of interest (ROIs) were selected per individual in a common anatomical region. A first matching between OI and healthy control group was performed by selecting similar individuals to obtain identical mean and median age and sex distribution. It allowed us to perform a first morphometric analysis and compare the outcome with literature. Then, stiffness tensors of the ROIs were computed using μFE and multiple linear regressions were performed with the Zysset-Curnier orthotropic fabric-elasticity model. An initial fit was performed on both the OI group and the healthy control group using all extracted ROIs. Then, data was filtered according to a fixed threshold for a defined coefficient of variation (CV) assessing ROI heterogeneity and additional linear regressions were performed on these filtered data sets. These full and filtered data were in turn compared with previous results from μCT reconstructions obtained in other anatomical locations. Finally, the ROIs of both groups were matched according to their BV/TV and degree of anisotropy (DA). Linear regressions were performed using these matched data to detect statistical differences between the two groups. Compared to healthy controls, we found the OI samples to have significantly lower BV/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.), significantly higher CV, trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.) and trabecular separation standard deviation (Tb.Sp.SD), but no differences in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.). These results are in agreement with previous studies. The stiffnesses of highly heterogeneous ROIs were randomly lower with respect to the fabric-elasticity relationships, which reflects the limit of validity of the computational homogenisation methodology. This limitation does not challenge the fabric-elasticity relationship, which extrapolation to heterogeneous ROIs is probably reasonable but can simply not be evaluated with the employed homogenisation methodology. Moreover, due to their low BV/TV, the potential (unknown) errors on these heterogeneous ROIs would have negligible influence on whole bone stiffness in comparison to homogeneous ROIs which are orders of magnitude stiffer. The filtering of highly heterogeneous ROIs removed these low stiffness ROIs and led to similar correlation coefficients for both OI and healthy groups. Finally, the BV/TV and DA matched data revealed no significant differences in fabric-elasticity parameters between OI and healthy individuals. Moreover, the filtering step did not exclude a particular OI type. Compared to previous studies, the stiffness constants from the 61 μm resolution HR-pQCT ROIs were lower than for the 36 μm resolution μCT ROIs. In conclusion, OI trabecular bone of the distal tibia was shown to be significantly more heterogeneous and have a lower BV/TV than healthy controls. Despite the reduced linear regression parameters found for HR-pQCT images, the fabric-elasticity relationships between OI and healthy individuals are similar when the trabecular bone ROIs are sufficiently homogeneous to perform the computational stiffness analysis. Accordingly, the elastic properties used for FEA of healthy bones are also valid for OI bones.}

   abstract = {Tissue Mechanics Stephen C. Cowin and Stephen B. Doty Tissue Mechanics, Second Edition is about the mechanics of tissues for use at the advanced undergraduate level or above. Tissues transmit mechanical loads just like bridges and building structures. Not only do they transmit loads, but also they adapt their own structures so that the structures will transmit the mechanical loads more effectively, unlike bridges and building structures. The structures of living tissues are continually changing due to growth and response to the tissue environment, including the mechanical environment. The objective of this text is to describe the nature of the composite components of a tissue, the cellular processes that produce these constituents, the assembly of the constituents into a hierarchical structure, and the behavior of the tissue's composite structure in the adaptation to its mechanical environment. A tissue's mechanical environment is the history of mechanical loading experienced by the tissue in some reference me period, like a day. The most important features of the textbook are its middle level, neither too advanced nor too elementary, its fresh perspective on older material issues, and the inclusion of new research results carefully crafted onto this intermediate base of mechanics. Key Features: An introductory chapter on the structure of tissues and the fascinating unresolved problems concerning how biological tissues are formed and constructed. Example problems to provide the student with hands-on experience with concepts Extensive appendices and tutorial materials on new developments including expanded treatment of ceramic materials and implants Detailed references for further reading As in TM, 1E a website (http://tissue-mechanics. com/) that has been established to provide supplemental material for the book. On this website is posted downloadable additional chapters on specific tissues, downloadable PowerPoint presentations of all the book's chapters, corrections to the published volume and additional exerc ses and examples for the existing chapters.

   abstract = {Introduction The application of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to assess bone microarchitecture has grown rapidly since its introduction in 2005. As the use of HR-pQCT for clinical research continues to grow, there is an urgent need to form a consensus on imaging and analysis methodologies so that studies can be appropriately compared. In addition, with the recent introduction of the second-generation HrpQCT, which differs from the first-generation HR-pQCT in scan region, resolution, and morphological measurement techniques, there is a need for guidelines on appropriate reporting of results and considerations as the field adopts newer systems. Methods A joint working group between the International Osteoporosis Foundation, American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, and European Calcified Tissue Society convened in person and by teleconference over several years to produce the guidelines and recommendations presented in this document. Results An overview and discussion is provided for (1) standardized protocol for imaging distal radius and tibia sites using HR-pQCT, with the importance of quality control and operator training discussed; (2) standardized terminology and recommendations on reporting results; (3) factors influencing accuracy and precision error, with considerations for longitudinal and multi-center study designs; and finally (4) comparison between scanner generations and other high-resolution CT systems. Conclusion This article addresses the need for standardization of HR-pQCT imaging techniques and terminology, provides guidance on interpretation and reporting of results, and discusses unresolved issues in the field.},

   abstract = {BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone mechanical properties assessed in vivo by finite element analysis were associated with wrist fracture in postmenopausal women. Introduction: Many fractures occur in individuals with normal BMD. Assessment of bone mechanical properties by finite element analysis (FEA) may improve identification of those at high risk for fracture. Materials and Methods: We used HR-pQCT to assess volumetric bone density, microarchitecture, and μFE-derived bone mechanical properties at the radius in 33 postmenopausal women with a prior history of fragility wrist fracture and 33 age-matched controls from the OFELY cohort. Radius areal BMD (aBMD) was also measured by DXA. Associations between density, microarchitecture, mechanical parameters and fracture status were evaluated by univariate logistic regression analysis and expressed as ORs (with 95% CIs) per SD change. We also conducted a principal components (PCs) analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of parameters and study their association (OR) with wrist fracture. Results: Areal and volumetric densities, cortical thickness, trabecular number, and mechanical parameters such as estimated failure load, stiffness, and the proportion of load carried by the trabecular bone at the distal and proximal sites were associated with wrist fracture (p < 0.05). The PCA revealed five independent components that jointly explained 86.2% of the total variability of bone characteristics. The first PC included FE-estimated failure load, areal and volumetric BMD, and cortical thickness, explaining 51% of the variance with an OR for wrist fracture = 2.49 (95% CI, 1.32-4.72). Remaining PCs did not include any density parameters. The second PC included trabecular architecture, explaining 12% of the variance, with an OR = 1.82 (95% CI, 0.94-3.52). The third PC included the proportion of the load carried by cortical versus trabecular bone, assessed by FEA, explaining 9% of the variance, and had an OR = 1.61 (95% CI, 0.94-2.77). Thus, the proportion of load carried by cortical versus trabecular bone seems to be associated with wrist fracture independently of BMD and microarchitecture (included in the first and second PC, respectively). Conclusions: These results suggest that bone mechanical properties assessed by μFE may provide information about skeletal fragility and fracture risk not assessed by BMD or architecture measurements alone and are therefore likely to enhance the prediction of wrist fracture risk. © 2008 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

   abstract = {Continuum finite element (FE) models are standard tools for determination of biomechanical properties of bones and bone-implant systems. This study investigates the accuracy of an enhanced continuum FE model by taking μ FE as the gold standard. The enhanced continuum models account for trabecular bone morphology (density and fabric) as well as for an anatomically correct cortical shell. Vertebral body slice models are extracted from high-resolution CT images using an algorithm proposed in [Pahr and Zysset, 2008b. From high-resolution CT data to FE models: development of an integrated modular framework. Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, in press.]. Three different models are generated: the proposed enhanced density-fabric-based model with a subject-specific cortex and two classical isotropic density-only models, with and without explicit modeling of the cortical shell. The material property errors of the used morphology-elasticity relationship are minimized by using elasticity tensors from 60 cubical μ FE models which are cropped from the trabecular centrums of the investigated vertebral bodies. Two different boundary conditions-kinematic [Van Rietbergen et al., 1995. A new method to determine trabecular bone elastic properties and loading using micromechanical FE models. Journal of Biomechanics 28 (1), 69-81] and mixed [Pahr, D.H., Zysset, P.K., 2008a. Influence of boundary conditions on computed apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology 7, 463-476.]-are used in these FE models. After removal of the endplates, compressive and antero-posterior shear loading is applied on the investigated vertebral bodies. Individual error sources are studied in more detail by loading also the trabecular centrum (removed shell) and the cortical shell alone. It is found that the cortex-only models need a correction of the shell thickness when transforming from a voxel to a smooth description. The trabecular centrum alone gives too stiff and too soft a response using material calibration with kinematic and mixed boundary conditions, respectively. A comparison of the whole vertebral body stiffnesses shows that an orthotropic cancellous bone material calibrated with kinematic boundary conditions corresponds best with μ FE. Taken together, the proposed enhanced homogenized surface-based FE model is structurally more accurate than density-only models. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Osteoporotic (Colles' type) fractures of the distal radius occur relatively early in lifetime and could estimate risk of fracture of other, more endangered anatomical sites. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) based micro finite element (μFE) analysis was shown to better predict fracture load of the distal radius than densitometry or histomorphometric measures. As an alternative to μFE, homogenization-based FE (hFE) approach may provide at least equivalent predictive power with reduced computational needs. The aim of this study was to validate the hFE approach with compression tests of 25 distal radius sections extracted at the location which is relevant in Colles' fractures. HR-pQCT-based input parameters of the hFE models were calibrated with respect to μCT. HR-pQCT-based hFE models were then built and their ability to predict experimental stiffness and ultimate load was compared to those of the density-based parameters, histomorphometric indices and μFE models assessed from the same input images. Bone mineral content was the best non-FE-based predictor (R2 = 0.86) of ultimate force. Both FE methods were not only the strongest predictors, but provided quantitatively correct fracture loads. The calibrated hFE approach provided closely as strong prediction (R2 = 0.94) as μFE (R2 = 0.95), but the former was computationally cheaper. The results of this validation study suggest that FE simulation could be used as an efficient and precise tool to predict Colles' fracture load. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

   abstract = {Fractures of the distal section of the radius (Colles’ fractures) occur earlier in life than other osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, they can be interpreted as a warning signal for later, more deleterious fractures of vertebral bodies or the femoral neck. In the past decade, the advent of HR-pQCT allowed a detailed architectural analysis of the distal radius and an automated but time-consuming estimation of its strength with linear micro-finite element (μFE) analysis. Recently, a second generation of HR-pQCT scanner (XtremeCT II, SCANCO Medical, Switzerland) with a resolution beyond 61 μm became available for even more refined biomechanical investigations in vivo. This raises the question how biomechanical outcome variables compare between the original (LR) and the new (HR) scanner resolution. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to validate experimentally a patient-specific homogenized finite element (hFE) analysis of the distal section of the human radius for the fast prediction of Colles’ fracture load based on the last generation HR-pQCT. Fourteen pairs of fresh frozen forearms (mean age = 77.5±9) were scanned intact using the high (61 μm) and the low (82 μm) resolution protocols that correspond to the new and original HR-pQCT systems. From each forearm, the 20 mm most distal section of the radius were dissected out, scanned with μCT at 16.4 μm and tested experimentally under compression up to failure for assessment of stiffness and ultimate load. Linear and nonlinear hFE models together with linear micro finite element (μFE) models were then generated based on the μCT and HR-pQCT reconstructions to predict the aforementioned mechanical properties of 24 sections. Precision errors of the short term reproducibility of the FE analyses were measured based on the repeated scans of 12 sections. The calculated failure loads correlated strongly with those measured in the experiments: accounting for donor as a random factor, the nonlinear hFE provided a marginal coefficient of determination (Rm2) of 0.957 for the high resolution (HR) and 0.948 for the low resolution (LR) protocols, the linear hFE with Rm2 of 0.957 for the HR and 0.947 for the LR protocols. Linear μFE predictions of the ultimate load were similar with an Rm2 of 0.950 for the HR and 0.954 for the LR protocols, respectively. Nonlinear hFE strength computation led to precision errors of 2.2 and 2.3% which were higher than the ones calculated based on the linear hFE (1.6 and 1.9%) and linear μFE (1.2 and 1.6%) for the HR and LR protocols respectively. Computation of the fracture load with nonlinear hFE demanded in average 6 h of CPU time which was 3 times faster than with linear μFE, while computation with linear hFE took only a few minutes. This study delivers an extensive experimental and numerical validation for the application of an accurate and fast hFE diagnostic tool to help in identifying individuals who may be at risk of an osteoporotic wrist fracture and to follow up pharmacological and other treatments in such patients.},

   abstract = {Summary: This study developed a well-standardized and reproducible approach for micro-finite element (mFE) and homogenized-FE (hFE) analyses that can accurately predict the distal radius failure load using either mFE or hFE models when using the approaches and parameters developed in this study. Introduction: Micro-FE analyses based on high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) images are frequently used to predict distal radius failure load. With the introduction of a second-generation HR-pQCT device, however, the default modelling approach no longer provides accurate results. The aim of this study was to develop a well-standardized and reproducible approach for mFE and hFE analyses that can provide precise and accurate results for distal radius failure load predictions based on second-generation HR-pQCT images. Methods: Second-generation HR-pQCT was used to scan the distal 20-mm section of 22 cadaver radii. The sections were excised and mechanically tested afterwards. For these sections, mFE and hFE models were made that were used to identify required material parameters by comparing predicted and measured results. Using these parameters, the models were cropped to represent the 10-mm region recommended for clinical studies to test their performance for failure load prediction. Results: After identification of material parameters, the measured failure load of the 20-mm segments was in good agreement with the results of mFE models (R2 = 0.969, slope = 1.035) and hFE models (R2 = 0.966, slope = 0.890). When the models were restricted to the clinical region, mFE still accurately predicted the measured failure load (R2 = 0.955, slope = 1.021), while hFE predictions were precise but tended to overpredict the failure load (R2 = 0.952, slope = 0.780). Conclusions: It was concluded that it is possible to accurately predict the distal radius failure load using either mFE or hFE models when using the approaches and parameters developed in this study.},

   abstract = {Introduction: HR-pQCT based micro finite element (μFE) analyses are considered as “gold standard” for virtual biomechanical analyses of peripheral bone sites such as the distal segment of radius and tibia. An attractive alternative for clinical use is a homogenized finite element method (hFE) based on constitutive models, because of its much shorter evaluation times and modest computational resource requirements. Such hFE models have been experimentally validated for the distal segment of the radius, but neither for the distal segments of the tibia nor for both measurement sites together. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to refine and experimentally validate an hFE processing pipeline for in vivo prediction of bone strength and stiffness at the distal segments of the radius and the tibia, using only one unified set of material properties. Material and methods: An existing hFE analysis procedure was refined in several aspects: 1) to include a faster evaluation of material orientation based on the mean surface length (MSL) method, 2) to distinguish cortical and trabecular bone compartments with distinct material properties and 3) to directly superimpose material properties in mixed phase elements instead of densities. Based on an existing dataset of the distal segment of fresh-frozen radii (double sections 20.4 mm, n = 21) and a newly established dataset of the distal segment of fresh-frozen tibiae (triple sections, 30.6 mm, n = 25), a single set of material properties was calibrated on the radius dataset and validated on the tibia dataset by comparing hFE stiffness and ultimate load with respective experimental results, obtained by compressing the samples on a servo-hydraulic testing machine at a monotonic and quasi-static displacement rate up to failure. Results: Using the identified set of material properties, the hFE-predicted stiffness and failure load were in excellent agreement with respective experimental results at both measurement sites (radius stiffness R2 = 0.93, slope = 1.00, intercept = 479 N/mm2/radius ultimate load: R2 = 0.97, slope = 1.00, intercept = 679 N; tibia stiffness R2 = 0.96, slope = 1.01, intercept = −1027 N/mm2/tibia ultimate load: R2 = 0.97, slope = 1.04, intercept = 394 N; combined dataset stiffness R2 = 0.95, slope = 1.01, intercept = −230 N/mm2/combined dataset ultimate load: R2 = 0.97, slope = 1.03, intercept = 495 N). Discussion and conclusion: In conjunction with unified BV/TV calibration, the established hFE pipeline accurately predicts experimental stiffness and ultimate load of distal multi-sections at the radius and tibia. Processing time for non-linear analysis was substantially reduced compared to previous μFE and hFE methods but could be further minimized by estimating bone strength based on a fast and linear analysis like as is currently done with μ FE.},

@article{Simon2024,
   abstract = {High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) based micro-finite element (μFE) analysis allows accurate prediction of stiffness and ultimate load of standardised (∼1 cm) distal radius and tibia sections. An alternative homogenized finite element method (hFE) was recently validated to compute the ultimate load of larger (∼2 cm) distal radius sections that include Colles' fracture sites. Since the mechanical integrity of the weight-bearing distal tibia is gaining clinical interest, it has been shown that the same properties can be used to predict the strength of both distal segments of the radius and the tibia. Despite the capacity of hFE to predict structural properties of distal segments of the radius and the tibia, the limitations of such homogenization scheme remain unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study is to build a complete mechanical data set of the compressive behavior of distal segments of the tibia and to compare quantitatively the structural properties with the hFE predictions. As a further aim, it is intended to verify whether hFE is also able to capture the post-yield strain localisation or fracture zones in such a bone section, despite the absence of strain softening in the constitutive model. Twenty-five fresh-frozen distal parts of tibias of human donors were used in this study. Sections were cut corresponding to an in-house triple-stack protocol HR-pQCT scan, lapped, and scanned using micro computed tomography (μCT). The sections were tested in compression until failure, unloaded and scanned again in μCT. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) were correlated to compression test results. hFE analysis was performed in order to compare computational predictions (stiffness, yield load and plastic deformation field pattern) with the compressive experiment. Namely, strain localization was assessed based on digital volume correlation (DVC) results and qualitatively compared to hFE predictions by comparing mid-slices patterns. Bone mineral content (BMC) showed a good correlation with stiffness (R2 = 0.92) and yield (R2 = 0.88). Structural parameters also showed good agreement between the experiment and hFE for both stiffness (R2 = 0.96, slope = 1.05 with 95 % CI [0.97, 1.14]) and yield (R2 = 0.95, slope = 1.04 [0.94, 1.13]). The qualitative comparison between hFE and DVC strain localization patterns allowed the classification of the samples into 3 categories: bad (15 sections), semi (8), and good agreement (2). The good correlations between BMC or hFE and experiment for structural parameters were similar to those obtained previously for the distal part of the radius. The failure zones determined by hFE corresponded to registration only in 8 % of the cases. We attribute these discrepancies to local elastic/plastic buckling effects that are not captured by the continuum-based FE approach exempt from strain softening. A way to improve strain localization hFE prediction would be to use longer distal segments with intact cortical shells, as done for the radius. To conclude, the used hFE scheme captures the elastic and yield response of the tibia sections reliably but not the subsequent failure process.},

   abstract = {An alternative concept of the relationship between morphological and elastic properties of trabecular bone is presented and applied to human tissue from several anatomical locations using a digital approach. The three-dimensional morphology of trabecular bone was assessed with a microcomputed tomography system and the method of directed secants as well as the star volume procedure were used to compute mean intercept length (MIL) and average bone length (ABL) of 4 mm cubic specimens. Assuming isotropic elastic properties for the trabecular tissue, the general elastic tensors of the bone specimens were determined using the homogenization method and the closest orthotropic tensors were calculated with an optimization algorithm. The assumption of orthotropy for trabecular bone was found to improve with specimen size and hold within 6.1 percent for a 4 mm cube size. A strong global relationship (r2 = 0.95) was obtained between fabric and the orthotropic elastic tensor with a minimal set of five constants. Mean intercept length and average bone length provided an equivalent power of prediction. These results support the hypothesis that the elastic properties of human trabecular bone from an arbitrary anatomical location can be estimated from an approximation of the anisotropic morphology and a prior knowledge of tissue properties. © 1998 by ASME.},
